This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Neighborhood Map

This is a map of <strong>Syracuse University</strong> of selected buildings. The map data is fetched via Google map API, and the pictures are from Flickr API.

The page is responsive, you can find a hamburger menu ![iconfinder_menu-alt_134216](/Users/junfang/Desktop/iconfinder_menu-alt_134216.svg)on the top left. A list of selected building will display if you click on the hamburger menu. You can filter the list by typing in letters in the search box. The corresponding map markers will appear on the map. Additionaly, if you mouse over the a building on the list or the marker, the corresponding marker on the map will bounce. If you click on the list or marker, an infowindow will show up with a picture of the event happened in that building, which is supported by Flickr.
